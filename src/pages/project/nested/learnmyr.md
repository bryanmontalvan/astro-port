## Description
MYR, a open source web-based application aimed at teaching K-12 students programming concepts through the creation of interactive virtual reality scenes. 

MYR is a university research project which is maintained by the research group [Engaging Computing](https://sites.uml.edu/engaging-computing/) Group at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.

The stack we use is a modified [MERN](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) stack using the following technologies,

**Frontend:**
- React.js
- Redux.js
- Bootstrap & Vanilla CSS

**Backend:**
- MongoDB
- Bare-metal servers provided by the school
- Docker (For CI/CD)

## My Work

For the first 9 months I developed for MYR as a developer, and then I was a project co-lead for 3 months. My work as a developer consisted of refreshing the website's UI. And as a lead, I oversaw a team of 4 undergraduate students. Together we would work together in an agile style and resolved a back-log of bugs and developed new features.
