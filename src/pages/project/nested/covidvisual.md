## Description

A project to familiarize myself with Grafana during my 2022 Spring co-op. This project allowed to me learn how Grafana uses data sources to create visualizations.

Using the Covid Tracking API (now deprecated) which is inserted into InfluxDB and then later queried into a local Grafana instance. There a map visual is used to visualize the covid cases by country or globally.
