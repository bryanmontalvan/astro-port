## Description
This website was created using Next.js in the front-end. The backend is composed of Firestore to store team images, and Firebase as a data-base which stores a reference to an image along with meta-data (such as title, date, etc).

The Firebase API allowed for a simple implementation of an admin-portal for the club's e-board to add, edit, and remove pictures from the website.
